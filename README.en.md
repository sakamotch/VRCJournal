## 🤔 Comparison with Other Tools

Various tools exist for VRChat, each serving different purposes. They can be used together.

**VRCJournal's Focus:**
- **Memory-focused**: A tool for reflecting on "where you were and what you did"
- **No login required**: No need to input VRChat account credentials
- **Personal experience only**: Does not track or monitor others

**Differences from Other Tools:**

Tools like [VRCX](https://github.com/vrcx-team/VRCX) and [VRC Friend Connect](https://booth.pm/ja/items/5098669) excel at tracking friends' online status and organizing friend relationships. They're ideal for real-time friend connections and relationship visualization.

VRCJournal, on the other hand, focuses on "preserving your own memories." Rather than tracking others' information, it records and organizes your personal experiences, photos, and visited worlds.

**Recommended for:**
- "Which world was I in a few months ago on that day?"
- "Where and with whom did I take this photo?"
- Those who prefer not to input VRChat credentials into external tools
- Those wanting to record personal experiences rather than manage friends

Since each tool serves different purposes, you can use them separately or together based on your needs.
